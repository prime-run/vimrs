- feat: config default kb opt in : disable all chords for mode exept defined ones in config (don't allow in default mode?)
- redesign whole configuration spesification (my depart toml?)
- support for timed sequences (implement when finished with remap and hold chords)



# should remapped chords follow mappings ?! (vim or nvim! approach!), 

- pros:
	- much simpler cofg filrs
	- easier `lua` configuration

- cons:
	- dangerous since it's system wide! (might lose keys in bad configs)
